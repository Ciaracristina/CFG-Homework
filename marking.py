Not going to make a PR for homework 3 as I'm aware we've already gone over that concept
So here is the feedback/marks which would normally be done through a PR

For your function you have received 7/8, a mark of 88
You lost one mark here unfortunately as your function started with 'test_' this means it can't be run
This is important to know that by default any function preceded with 'test_' is used for unit tests
This means you can't use that prefix for normal functions.

Great work!
